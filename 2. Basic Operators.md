An *operator* is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values.

Operators are unary, binary, or ternary:

-   *Unary* operators operate on a single target (such as `a`). Unary *prefix* operators appear immediately before their target (such as `!b`), and unary *postfix* operators appear immediately after their target (such as `c!`).
-   *Binary* operators operate on two targets (such as `2 + 3`) and are *infix* because they appear in between their two targets.
-   *Ternary* operators operate on three targets. Like C, Swift has only one ternary operator, the ternary conditional operator (`a ? b : c`).

### Arithmetic Operators

Swift supports the four standard *arithmetic operators* for all number types:

-   Addition (`+`)
-   Subtraction (``)
-   Multiplication (``)
-   Division (`/`)

```
1. 1 + 2       // equals 3

2. 5 - 3       // equals 2

3. 2 * 3       // equals 6

4. 10.0 / 2.5  // equals 4.0

```

Unlike the arithmetic operators in C and Objective-C, the Swift arithmetic operators don't allow values to overflow by default. You can opt in to value overflow behavior by using Swift's overflow operators (such as `a &+ b`).

### Ternary Conditional Operator

The *ternary conditional operator* is a special operator with three parts, which takes the form `question ? answer1 : answer2`. It's a shortcut for evaluating one of two expressions based on whether `question` is true or false. If `question` is true, it evaluates `answer1` and returns its value; otherwise, it evaluates `answer2` and returns its value.

```
let contentHeight = 40
let hasHeader = true
let rowHeight = contentHeight + (hasHeader ? 50 : 20)
// rowHeight is equal to 90

```

### Nil-Coalescing Operator

The *nil-coalescing operator* (`a ?? b`) unwraps an optional `a` if it contains a value, or returns a default value `b` if `a` is `nil`. The expression `a` is always of an optional type. The expression `b`must match the type that's stored inside `a`.

The nil-coalescing operator is shorthand for the code below:

```
1\. a != nil ? a! : b

```

The example below uses the nil-coalescing operator to choose between a default color name and an optional user-defined color name:

```
let defaultColorName = "red"
var userDefinedColorName: String?   // defaults to nil
var colorNameToUse = userDefinedColorName ?? defaultColorName
// userDefinedColorName is nil, so colorNameToUse is set to the default of "red"

```

The `userDefinedColorName` variable is defined as an optional `String`, with a default value of `nil`. Because `userDefinedColorName` is of an optional type, you can use the nil-coalescing operator to consider its value.

In the example above, the operator is used to determine an initial value for a `String` variable called `colorNameToUse`. Because `userDefinedColorName` is `nil`, the expression `userDefinedColorName ?? defaultColorName` returns the value of `defaultColorName`, or `"red"`.

### **Range Operators**

**Closed Range Operator**

The *closed range operator* (`a...b`) defines a range that runs from `a` to `b`, and includes the values `a` and `b`. The value of `a` must not be greater than `b`.

```
for index in 1...5 {
    print("\\(index) times 5 is \\(index * 5)")
}
// 1 times 5 is 5
// 2 times 5 is 10
// 3 times 5 is 15
// 4 times 5 is 20
// 5 times 5 is 25

```

**Half-Open Range Operator**

The *half-open range operator* (`a..<b`) defines a range that runs from `a` to `b`, but doesn't include `b`. It's said to be *half-open* because it contains its first value, but not its final value. As with the closed range operator, the value of `a` must not be greater than `b`. If the value of `a` is equal to `b`, then the resulting range will be empty.

```
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
let count = names.count
for i in 0..<count {
    print("Person \\(i + 1) is called \\(names[i])")
}
// Person 1 is called Anna
// Person 2 is called Alex
// Person 3 is called Brian
// Person 4 is called Jack

```

**One-Sided Ranges**

The closed range operator has an alternative form for ranges that continue as far as possible in one direction---for example, a range that includes all the elements of an array from index 2 to the end of the array. In these cases, you can omit the value from one side of the range operator. This kind of range is called a *one-sided range* because the operator has a value on only one side. For example:

```
for name in names[2...] {
    print(name)
}
// Brian
// Jack

for name in names[...2] {
    print(name)
}
// Anna
// Alex
// Brian

```

The half-open range operator also has a one-sided form that's written with only its final value. Just like when you include a value on both sides, the final value isn't part of the range. For example:

```
1\. for name in names[..<2] {

2.     print(name)

3. }

4. // Anna

5. // Alex

```

### Logical Operators

*Logical operators* modify or combine the Boolean logic values `true` and `false`. Swift supports the three standard logical operators found in C-based languages:

-   Logical NOT (`!a`)
-   Logical AND (`a && b`)
-   Logical OR (`a || b`)

> NOTE

> The Swift logical operators `&&` and `||` are left-associative, meaning that compound expressions with multiple logical operators evaluate the leftmost subexpression first.
