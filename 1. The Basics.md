### Constants and Variables

Constants and variables associate a name (such as  `welcomeMessage`) with a value of a particular type (such as the string `"Hello"`). The value of a *constant* can't be changed once it's set, whereas a *variable* can be set to a different value in the future.

Constants and variables must be declared before they're used. You declare constants with the `let` keyword and variables with the `var` keyword.

```
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10

var currentLoginAttempt = 0

```

### Type Annotations

You can provide a *type annotation* when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store. Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use.

```
var welcomeMessage: String

```

You can define multiple related variables of the same type on a single line, separated by commas, with a single type annotation after the final variable name:

```
var red, green, blue: Double

```

Constant and variable names can't contain whitespace characters, mathematical symbols, arrows, private-use Unicode scalar values, or line- and box-drawing characters. Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name.

Once you've declared a constant or variable of a certain type, you can't declare it again with the same name, or change it to store values of a different type. Nor can you change a constant into a variable or a variable into a constant.

> NOTE

> If you need to give a constant or variable the same name as a reserved Swift keyword, surround the keyword with backticks (```) when using it as a name. However, avoid using keywords as names unless you have absolutely no choice.

You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the `print(_:separator:terminator:)` function:

```
print(friendlyWelcome)
// Prints "Bonjour!"

```

The `separator` and `terminator` parameter have default values, so you can omit them when you call this function. By default, the function terminates the line it prints by adding a line break. To print a value without a line break after it, pass an empty string as the terminator---for example, `print(someValue, terminator: "")`

Swift uses *string interpolation* to include the name of a constant or variable as a placeholder in a longer string, and to prompt Swift to replace it with the current value of that constant or variable.

```
print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \\(friendlyWelcome)")

```

Use comments to include non-executable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when your code is compiled.

Comments in Swift are very similar to comments in C. Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (`//`):

```
1\. // This is a comment.

```

Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (`/*`) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (`*/`):

```
1\. /* This is also a comment

2. but is written over multiple lines. */

```

Unlike multiline comments in C, multiline comments in Swift can be nested inside other multiline comments. You write nested comments by starting a multiline comment block and then starting a second multiline comment within the first block. The second block is then closed, followed by the first block:

```
1\. /* This is the start of the first multiline comment.

2.  /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */

3. This is the end of the first multiline comment. */

```

Nested multiline comments enable you to comment out large blocks of code quickly and easily, even if the code already contains multiline comments.

### **Type Safety and Type Inference**

Swift is a *type-safe* language. A type safe language encourages you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with.

If part of your code requires a `String`, you can't pass it an `Int` by mistake.

Because Swift is type safe, it performs *type checks* when compiling your code and flags any mismatched types as errors.

This enables you to catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.

Type-checking helps you avoid errors when you're working with different types of values. However, this doesn't mean that you have to specify the type of every constant and variable that you declare.

If you don't specify the type of value you need, Swift uses *type inference* to work out the appropriate type. Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.

### **Numeric Type Conversion**

To convert one specific number type to another, you initialize a new number of the desired type with the existing value.

```
let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000
let one: UInt8 = 1
let twoThousandAndOne = twoThousand + UInt16(one)

```

`SomeType(ofInitialValue)` is the default way to call the initializer of a Swift type and pass in an initial value. Behind the scenes, `UInt16` has an initializer that accepts a `UInt8` value, and so this initializer is used to make a new `UInt16` from an existing `UInt8`. You can't pass in *any* type here, however---it has to be a type for which `UInt16` provides an initializer.

Extending existing types to provide initializers that accept new types (including your own type definitions) is covered in [Extensions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Extensions.html).

### **Tuples**

*Tuples* group multiple values into a single compound value. The values within a tuple can be of any type and don't have to be of the same type as each other.

In this example, `(404, "Not Found")` is a tuple that describes an *HTTP status code*. An HTTP status code is a special value returned by a web server whenever you request a web page. A status code of `404 Not Found` is returned if you request a webpage that doesn't exist.

```
1\. let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")

2. // http404Error is of type (Int, String), and equals (404, "Not Found")

```

It can be described as "a tuple of type `(Int, String)`".

You can *decompose* a tuple's contents into separate constants or variables, which you then access as usual:

```
1\. let (statusCode, statusMessage) = http404Error

2. print("The status code is \\(statusCode)")

3. // Prints "The status code is 404"

4. print("The status message is \\(statusMessage)")

5. // Prints "The status message is Not Found"

```

If you only need some of the tuple's values, ignore parts of the tuple with an underscore (`_`) when you decompose the tuple:

```
1\. let (justTheStatusCode, _) = http404Error

2. print("The status code is \\(justTheStatusCode)")

3. // Prints "The status code is 404"

```

Alternatively, access the individual element values in a tuple using index numbers starting at zero:

```
1\. print("The status code is \\(http404Error.0)")

2. // Prints "The status code is 404"

3. print("The status message is \\(http404Error.1)")

4. // Prints "The status message is Not Found"

```

You can name the individual elements in a tuple when the tuple is defined:

```
1\. let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")

```

If you name the elements in a tuple, you can use the element names to access the values of those elements:

```
1\. print("The status code is \\(http200Status.statusCode)")

2. // Prints "The status code is 200"

3. print("The status message is \\(http200Status.description)")

4. // Prints "The status message is OK"

```

Tuples are particularly useful as the return values of functions. A function that tries to retrieve a web page might return the `(Int, String)`tuple type to describe the success or failure of the page retrieval.

### **Optionals**

You use *optionals* in situations where a value may be absent. An optional represents two possibilities: Either there *is* a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there *isn't* a value at all.

**Example:**

Here's an example of how optionals can be used to cope with the absence of a value. Swift's `Int` type has an initializer which tries to convert a `String` value into an `Int` value. However, not every string can be converted into an integer. The string `"123"` can be converted into the numeric value `123`, but the string `"hello, world"` doesn't have an obvious numeric value to convert to.

The example below uses the initializer to try to convert a `String` into an `Int`:

```
1\. let possibleNumber = "123"

2. let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)

3. // convertedNumber is inferred to be of type "Int?", or "optional Int"

```

Because the initializer might fail, it returns an *optional* `Int`, rather than an `Int`. An optional `Int`is written as `Int?`, not `Int`. The question mark indicates that the value it contains is optional, meaning that it might contain *some* `Int` value, or it might contain *no value at all*. (It can't contain anything else, such as a `Bool` value or a `String` value. It's either an `Int`, or it's nothing at all.)

### **nil**

You set an optional variable to a valueless state by assigning it the special value `nil`:

```
1\. var serverResponseCode: Int? = 404

2. // serverResponseCode contains an actual Int value of 404

3. serverResponseCode = nil

4. // serverResponseCode now contains no value

```

> NOTE

> You can't use `nil` with non-optional constants and variables. If a constant or variable in your code needs to work with the absence of a value under certain conditions, always declare it as an optional value of the appropriate type.

If you define an optional variable without providing a default value, the variable is automatically set to `nil` for you:

```
1\. var surveyAnswer: String?

2. // surveyAnswer is automatically set to nil

```

### If Statements and Forced Unwrapping

You can use an `if` statement to find out whether an optional contains a value by comparing the optional against `nil`. You perform this comparison with the "equal to" operator (`==`) or the "not equal to" operator (`!=`).

If an optional has a value, it's considered to be "not equal to" `nil`:

```
1\. if convertedNumber != nil {

2.     print("convertedNumber contains some integer value.")

3. }

4. // Prints "convertedNumber contains some integer value."

```

Once you're sure that the optional *does* contain a value, you can access its underlying value by adding an exclamation point (`!`) to the end of the optional's name.

The exclamation point effectively says, "I know that this optional definitely has a value; please use it." This is known as *forced unwrapping* of the optional's value:

```
1\. if convertedNumber != nil {

2.     print("convertedNumber has an integer value of \\(convertedNumber!).")

3. }

4. // Prints "convertedNumber has an integer value of 123."

```

### Optional Binding

You use *optional binding* to find out whether an optional contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant or variable.

Optional binding can be used with `if`and `while` statements to check for a value inside an optional, and to extract that value into a constant or variable, as part of a single action.

```
1\. if let actualNumber = Int(possibleNumber) {

2.     print("The string \\"\\(possibleNumber)\\" has an integer value of \\(actualNumber)")

3. } else {

4.     print("The string \\"\\(possibleNumber)\\" couldn't be converted to an integer")

5. }

6. // Prints "The string "123" has an integer value of 123"

```

"If the optional `Int` returned by `Int(possibleNumber)` contains a value, set a new constant called `actualNumber` to the value contained in the optional."

You can include as many optional bindings and Boolean conditions in a single `if` statement as you need to, separated by commas.

If any of the values in the optional bindings are `nil` or any Boolean condition evaluates to `false`, the whole `if` statement's condition is considered to be `false`.
